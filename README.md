## What is DRHM?

DRHM is an open-source personal finance tracker designed specifically for Morocco. Most finance apps don't support Moroccan banks, currencies, or spending patterns. DRHM does.

Import your CIH Bank PDF statements, track spending by category, set budgets, and get insights — all from a clean, self-hosted dashboard that you fully control.

---

## Features

### 📥 Bank Statement Import
- **PDF Import** — Upload your CIH Bank monthly statement and all transactions are automatically extracted, categorized, and deduplicated
- **CSV Import** — Import transactions from any spreadsheet with automatic column mapping
- **Smart deduplication** — Re-importing the same statement won't create duplicate transactions
- **Import history** — Full log of every import with transaction counts and status

### 💸 Transaction Management
- View, search, filter, and sort all transactions
- Filter by account, category, type, date range, or keyword
- Edit or delete individual transactions
- Bulk select and delete multiple transactions at once
- Manual transaction entry for cash or untracked spending

### 📊 Dashboard & Insights
- Monthly summary: total spent, total income, net balance
- 6-month spending trend chart
- Category breakdown with visual pie chart
- Top merchants by spending
- Smart insights: budget alerts, new merchants, spending changes
- Navigate between months to view historical data

### 🗂 Categories & Auto-Categorization
- Pre-built categories: Groceries, Food & Dining, Transport, Health, Subscriptions, Utilities, ATM & Cash, Transfer, and more
- Automatic categorization on import using merchant name matching
- Custom rules engine — define your own categorization rules based on keywords

### 💰 Budgets
- Set monthly budgets per category
- Real-time progress tracking
- Over-budget alerts on the dashboard

### 🏦 Multi-Account Support
